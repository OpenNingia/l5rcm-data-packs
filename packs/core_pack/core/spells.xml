		</Raises>
		<Description>This spell can be cast in any element save Void. It allows the caller to speak with one of the local elemental kami, asking it a few questions, which it will answer honestly to the best of its ability. Typically this spell will invoke the most active and energetic spirit of the chosen element in the area of effect; if all of the local spirits are quiescent. The GM may require the caster call 1 or 2 Raises to wake up a local spirit enough answer questions. A spirit reached with Commune will answer questions. The caster may Raise to get more questions (one per Raise). The caster may also Raise for clarity, get a more accurate and informative answer the questions. (Kami are notorious for their inability Tully comprehend human behavior, and asking questions without Raises for clarity can often result in confusing, enigmatic, or incomplete answers.) Spirits snot forget anything. So theoretically a shugenja can ask a spirit about something that happened decades ago; however, they do not experience time in the same way as mortals. Straying task about something from long agile usually require Raises in order make the caster's wishes clear the spirit. The nature of the information which spirits can impart varies by element: Air spirits tend to be playful and easily distracted, conveying information as emotions or as riddles and jokes. Since they are more interested in feelings than in facts, and enjoy playing games with those speak with them, communing with an Air spirit can sometimes be very frustrating. Earth spirits are straightforward and matter-of-fact, often blunt, but are rather uninterested in the behavior of mortals, have a poor understanding of human emotion, and tend to be overly focused on obscure details such as the color of a piece of clothing or the weight of a horse. Fire spirits are irritable and temperamental, and are often angry at being summoned unless they are propitiated with an offering of something burn. On the other hand, if a shugenja can please them they tend to offer the clearest and most accurate information. Water spirits communicate their knowledge through soundless visual images. This can be very helpful ta shugenja trying investigate a past incident, but since the spirits cannot convey scent, sound, or emotion, the information they provide can often be incomplete or misleading.</Description>

		<Description>This spell can be cast in any of the four standard elements. It allows the caster sense the presence, quantity, and rough location of elemental spirits (not the evil spirits known as kansen) of that element within the range of the spell. This is most frequently applied when looking for spirits with which commune (see below), but can also be useful as a crude, basic location device. For example, a caster lost in the wilderness could cast Sense (Water) in hopes of locating a source of drinking water.</Description>

		</Raises>
		<Description>This spell can be cast in any of the four standard elements. It allows the caster to summon a modest quantity (one cubic foot) of the chosen element. The summoned matter appears (usually in a rough hall shape) in any open space within the spells range. This cannot place the summoned material inside another physical object or living creature. The summoned element will behave in a normal and mundane matter - Earth falls the ground, water soaks anything it lands on, air blows away, and fire winks out unless there is something present for it burn. In general it is impossible to use this spell effectively in combat, although clever shugenja may find a few modest combat uses, such as using Summon Fire to ignite a foe soaked in cooking oil. More commonly, the spells value is in simpler functions, such as summoning Water while in a desert, or summoning Fire to light a campfire without flint and tinder. Raises may be used with this spell summon a more specific type of the appropriate element, such as wood or iron with Earth, or tea with Water. The GM should choose how many Raises (generally anywhere from 1 to 4) this requires. However, these Raises cannot be used create rare/precious materials (such as gold) or spiritually powerful substances (such as jade or crystal).</Description>

    <Description>This spell infuses the targets (who may include the caster) with firm and unyielding courage, bolstered by the eternal power of the Earth. For the duration of the spell, all the targets gain +5k to resist any kind of Fear effect, whether magical or natural. However, this spell is associated with the memory of the legendary Seven Thunders, and those whose connection the Thunders is tenuous do not receive the same degree of blessing from the Earth kami. Samurai who are not of the original Seven Great Clans receive only + 3k to their rolls to resist Fear. Anyone who has at least a full Rank of Shadowlands Taint cannot benefit from this spell, although this will not actually reveal that they are tainted. This spell may be cast as a combined ritual by two or more shugenja who know the spell, in which case they may add their highest single Earth Rank to their combined total School Ranks to determine how many targets the spell can affect.</Description>

When the shugenja casts this spell, he chooses one Element (which cannot be Void or Maho). Spells of that element suffer a TN penalty equal the caster's School Rank x 5 when they are cast on anyone under the protection of this spell.

		<Description>This spell summons forth the purest of Earth kami, those of jade, in the form of a blast of iridescent green energy. The jade power flies out and unerringly strikes the chosen target. It cannot be intercepted or deflected, although Magic Resistance or other forms of magical Defense can thwart it. If the target has at least one Rank of Taint, the Jade Strike will inflict damage with a DR of 3k3, burning and blackening the Tainted flesh. However, a target who does not have at least a full Rank of Taint will not suffer any damage from the spell. Casting Jade Strike on a non-Tainted target is generally regarded as a grave insult - except perhaps among the more paranoid ranks of the Kuni family, where it is seen as merely a sensible precaution.</Description>

		<Description>This spell fills the target's body with the purity and vigor of Earth, driving out poisons and impurities. If the target suffers the effects of any poison or toxin within the duration of the spell, or is already under the effects of a poison when the spell targets him, he may re-roll any failed Stamina roll to resist the poison, with a bonus of +2k the second roll. (However, if the second roll is also failed, the poison has full effect.) An interesting side-effect of this spell is that it also cures drunkenness and other such effects, and it is impossible for the target to become intoxicated during the spells duration.</Description>

It is used to safely imprison minor Shadowlands creatures, typically for purposes of interrogation. Any Shadowlands creature with an Earth of 3 or less can be targeted with this spell. It cannot affect the Lost, Oni Lords or their spawn, or creatures with an Earth of 4 or higher, nor can it affect creatures who are not tainted. If the spell is cast successfully, it calls forth manacles of iron, formed from pure Earth spirits, which trap and bind the target creature, rendering it physically helpless for the duration of the spell.

He gains a +3k bonus to any rolls made to resist emotional manipulation or the distractions of desire, including Courtier (Manipulation) rolls, Temptation rolls, Compulsions, and any similar effects which the GM judges to be appropriate. However, this stony self-control also makes it difficult for the target to read and affect the emotions of others, and for the duration of the spell he suffers a -1k penalty to all Awareness Trait rolls and Awareness-related Skill Rolls made for the purpose of influencing others.</Description>

		<Description>Destruction is one of the basic impulses of Fire, and this spell calls on that urge to spread destruction in the caster's surroundings. The spell whips the kami into a frenetic chaos, destroying everything around you. Everyone in the area of effect, including you, suffers damage with DR equal to your Fire Ring. This result is rolled once and applied to everyone within the area. However, you take only half damage (rounded up), since the kami makes some effort to avoid you.</Description>

		<Description>Fire is the element of creation as well as destruction, and a skilled shugenja can use this to great effect. This spell invokes the powers of the forge, mighty and merciless, to remake a material item, such as a weapon or suit of armor, into its perfect form. The target item loses all blemishes, including cracks or nicks. This spell cannot repair an item which has actually been broken or destroyed, however, and it can only affect items that are of ordinary quality.</Description>

		<Description>The most essential lesson of the ishiken is that all is linked through the Void, and through the Void all can be perceived. By focusing your energy, you can look through the veil and see another location as if you were standing there. This location must be familiar to you, and you must have been there at least once before. For the duration of the spell, you can see and hear all that transpires in the other location, but you may not be detected and you may not interact with things or individuals there in any way. During this spell, your body is in a trance-like state that leaves you highly vulnerable to attack (your Armor TN is reduced to 5).</Description>

You would know if there were the three humans waiting outside the castle wall, for instance, but you would not recognize them other than to know that they were present.

If this spell is successfully cast on an object, you automatically learn all powers and abilities that object possesses. This is most frequently used to identify any supernatural qualities an item possesses, such as a Nemuranai or a cursed weapon, but it can also identify the spell contained within a shugenja's prayer scroll. This spell will not allow a shugenja to read a scroll if it is written in a cipher he does not understand, but he can at least identify the spell in question. This spell will also grant the caster knowledge of the item's origin in very broad strokes, such as where it was forged, the Clan of the individual who has carried it the longest, or something similar at the GM's discretion.</Description>

Any opponent who attempts to strike the person wearing the armor, whether or not the attack hits, is immediately considered to be Fatigued until the beginning of their next Tum. The penalties apply to the attack roll that triggered the spell, and any attackers in the Full Attack Posture immediately assume the Attack Posture instead.

		<Description>Although Earth is the traditional method of opposing evil forces like the Shadowlands Taint, the spirits of Fire can also be invoked to purge and destroy such spiritual abominations. This spell binds a Fire kami into a specific location which it protects against the forces of evil. Casting the spell requires inscribing elaborate kanji on a flat surface in chalk or ink, and takes one minute of concentrated effort, after which the Spell Casting Roll must be made. Once the Ward of Purity is activated and the power of the kami is fully engaged, however, the kami within the inscription protects the area against the influence of the Shadowlands or the Lying Darkness. Persons or creatures with at least 1 Shadowlands Taint Rank, or who are under the control of the Lying Darkness, must make a successful Contested Willpower Roll against you in order to enter the Ward's area of effect; you gain a +5 bonus to this roll. In addition, those creatures who successfully enter the area suffer extreme pain, as the power of the ward burns their very essence. Their bodies ignite and they suffer Wounds equal to the total of your Fire Ring + insight Rank each Round they remain within the area of effect. Spells and missiles are unaffected by Ward of Purity. The object upon which the ward is inscribed must remain immobile and the inscription must remain dearly visible at all times, or else the Ward is dispelled. If overlapping Wards of Purity are present, their effects do not stack.</Description>

		<Description>This spell is a more powerful and specialized form of Minor Binding. It is a ritual designed to bind or dispel troublesome creatures from the various spirit realms. Any creature from the realms of Sakkaku, Chikushudo, Gaki-Do, Toshigoku, or Yume-Dan be affected by this spell. Casting it requires 10 minutes, although if additional shugenja who know the spell assist in the ritual, the time is reduced by 1 minute per additional shugenja, to a minimum of 1 minute. If the targeted creature is within range of the caster(s) when the spell is successfully completed, the creature can be either bound or dispelled. If it is bound, it must obey the caster's commands for the duration of the spell, although suicidal commands will break the spell - this is how the Kuni have forced mujina spirits to labor for them in their iron mines. (It should be noted that this use of the spell is considered controversial and even blasphemous by many in Rokugan.) If the creature is dispelled, it immediately leaves Ningen-Do its native spirit realm, and cannot return until the spells duration ends. Either way, the spirit creature will regard the caster as an enemy thereafter, and is likely to seek vengeance if it can.</Description>

		<Description>This spell was originally created by the Kuni family and is still primarily practised by them, although knowledge of its prayers has spread to other Clans. It is an elaborate ritual spell, requiring an hour to cast, that calls on the powers of Earth to purge the land of the Shadowlands Taint, driving out all the evil kansen in the area. The spell will remove all the Taint from the land, plant life, and inanimate objects within the area of effect. It will not remove Taint from living creatures, nor will it affect powerful Tainted artifacts or objects made of obsidian. The removal of the Taint, however, is not without price. The elemental kami in the area of effect are also weakened and purged by the spell, especially the Earth spirits whose efforts are called upon to power it. In the aftermath of casting this spell, the local spirits will be scattered and weakened, inflicting a + 15 TN penalty on all Spell Casting rolls within the area. This negative effect will sometimes fade with time, especially if it was cast in a single location surrounded by normal lands. But if the spell is cast over a wide area, such as the Kuni Wastes, the elemental kami will usually permanently leave the area, reducing it to a gray, lifeless wasteland.</Description>

		<Description>This spell has existed in Rokugan for centuries, but is best known for its extensive use by Toturi Sezaru, "the Wolf," who employed it during his hunts for Bloodspeakers. It calls on the power of the Earth to afflict the target, weighing down his body and impeding his muscles, leaving him weak and vulnerable. The target's Earth Ring is lowered by 1 Rank, and his Wound Ranks are reduced correspondingly for the duration of the spell. (This can potentially kill him immediately if he has already suffered Wounds.) In addition, his Strength Rank is also lowered by 1 for the same duration. If the target has at least one full Rank of Shadow lands Taint, the Earth spirits will be filled with wrath, and punish him more severely, lowering his Earth Ring by 2 Ranks (to a minimum of 1).</Description>

		<Description>Fiery Wrath was originally created to clear brush for farming and to demolish wooden structures with a minimum of work and no hazard. It is also used to start bonfires for rituals and celebrations. The spell allows you to destroy a building or other structure by appealing to the excitable Fire kami with in the target's materials. All flammable materials within the area of effect immediately catch fire and burn until nothing but ash is left. The fire cannot be extinguished except by magical means; mundane water, sand, and other retardants would have no effect. Only one structure may be targeted by the spell, and the fire will not spread out to adjoining structures, as your prayers keep the Fire kami under tight control. Living beings and materials that are not flammable are not affected. In fact, while clothes worn by people caught within the area of effect will burn, their flesh will not so much as singe.</Description>

		<Description>Fire spirits are known for their erratic and temperamental nature, and shugenja can badly disrupt their foes in battle by imbuing them with this aspect of the element. The target of this spell is filled with the unfocused fury of Fire, enraging him and forcing him to lose perspective. The target immediately assumes the Full Attack Stance and cannot switch from that Stance for the duration of the spell. If the spell is cast out of Battle, the target gains the Brash and Contrary Disadvantages for the duration of the spell. This spells effects can be overcome by those of strong will. The target can attempt to resist with an opposed Willpower roll, but you add you’re Fire to the total of your roll. If the spell is cast in battle, this roll occurs during the Reactions Stage of Battle. The roll occurs once every 10 minutes.</Description>

		<Description>This spell is a more potent version of Biting Steel, designed to enhance any weapon rather than merely a sword. The spell strengthens the Fire spirits in a single target weapon, causing them to come forth and form a faint sheath of fire around it. The weapon's wielder adds +1k to all attack rolls, and all of his damage dice explode on a result of 8 or better. Each die can explode on an 8 or 9 only once per roll, however, even if the wielder has other effects that allow the die to explode on 9s.</Description>

		<Description>A more powerful and sophisticated form of the prayer which invokes the Fires From Within. This spell not only damages the target but also disrupts his own attempts to invoke the Fire kami, making it a very effective weapon against a rival Fire shugenja. You summon forth a bolt of flames that streaks toward the target with wild abandon. The flames deal 4k3 Wounds on impact and then encircle the opponent for the duration of the spell, waiting for him to make a mistake. If the target casts any Fire spell during that time, the Fire kami instantly strike, dealing 3k3 extra Wounds and causing the Spell Casting Roll to automatically fail. (The target loses the appropriate spell slot as usual.)</Description>

The armor emits a bright light that becomes blinding whenever the wearer is attacked. Any time the armor's wearer is attacked in melee, immediately afterward the opponent takes 2k2 Wounds and is Blinded until the Reactions Stage of the same Round.

Weak structures and those easily set on fire (such as most Rokugani homes) are destroyed by the spells fury, or catch fire and are consumed. The spell has a DR equal to your Fire Ring, inflicting this damage on anyone caught within the area of effect Using this spell in populated areas is generally considered a criminal act, unless the shugenja can cite extreme circumstances, since fires are terribly dangerous to Rokugani cities.</Description>

Using this spell on a calligraphy brush, for example, might show the last person who used it to write a letter. Using it on a weapon might instead show the last death it was used to inflict. The GM has ultimate authority over what vision the spell imparts. Extremely important objects, such as ancestral weapons or standards, may have powerful visions that grip the caster for longer periods of time, rather than imparting simple instantaneous visions.</Description>

Upon completion of a successful casting of this spell, you may immediately cast a second spell of any element. This second spell must be a spell you can normally cast, and it must be of Mastery Level 3 or lower. If the second Spell Casting Roll is successful, the second spell is stored within you, and will not activate until a specific physical effect takes place, which you specify at the time of the casting. The spells trigger could be that you speak a certain word, draw a blade, or fall in Battle, for example. Whatever the trigger, when it occurs, the second spell immediately takes effect as if you had just finished casting the spell. A character may never benefit from multiple uses of Silent Waters at one time. If a second use of the spell is cast on the same individual, the currently stored spell is immediately dispelled and replaced with the new one.</Description>

		<Description>Although not as reliable as the natural,if extremely rare gift of foresight or the equally rare Void spells that enable divination, this spell still allows powerful visions of the future. It was first developed by the Tonbo Family of the Dragonfly Clan, and is found infrequently outside their ranks. The spell requires use of a large pool of still Water into which you must gaze. Upon completion of the spell, you enter a brief trance, and see images of things that have not yet come to pass. These Images are rarely direct, and tend to be symbolic (violence is depicted as a scene of battle, for instance) but the events foreseen are completely accurate, and will come to pass unless prevented by your direct intervention. Only the shugenja casting this spell may see the events depicted in the vision. Many shugenja believe that use of this spell is a means of thwarting the natural order, and regard both it and those who make use of it negatively.</Description>

Call the Spirit allows a shugenja summon any particular spirit, regardless of its realm, to have a discussion. You may use this spell to summon any spirit from any of the spirit realms, although realm denizens that are not spirits (such as Fortunes) are immune. If you know something specific about the spirit, either having seen it before or having intimate knowledge of its actions (for example, "the spirit that killed my father"), you may summon that spirit in particular. The nature of the spell prevents the spirit from attacking you unless you attack first, but it will not necessarily be friendly. The spirit disappears as soon as the spells duration expires. This spell can potentially summon extremely dangerous creatures, such as oni, and should be used with caution.</Description>

When Tomb of Jade is cast, the target is momentarily immobilized as the Earth spirits enter his body.

If the caster wins, the target takes 2k2 Wounds as the spirits begin transform his body into jade.

		<Description>This extremely invasive spell is considered blasphemous by most honorable shugenja, and many respectable shugenja orders would deem its use reason for excommunication if not outright execution. This spell calls upon the air kami befuddle and dismay a target, invading their mind and influencing their ability to recall exactly what happened to them over a certain length of time. When this spell is successfully cast against a target, you must succeed at a Contested Roll using your Air versus the target’s Earth. If successful, the target's memories are disrupted, and they forget what has happened to them over the course of the past week (five days). This information is completely lost the target. What's more, the spell renders them extremely susceptible to suggestion, and you can tell them what happened to them over the course of the missing time. This allows unscrupulous shugenja to exploit others and essentially give them false memories, although certain individuals are highly resistant to this manner of manipulation. It is possible to determine that an individual was the target of this spell through use of the Commune spell, but it requires that the kami be specifically asked if they can detect any such manipulation.</Description>

		<Description>The more powerful counterpart the Kuni family's Minor Binding spell, this spell has also been employed by other clan shugenja, especially those of the Phoenix Clan. It is used to imprison more powerful Shadowlands creatures and members of the Lost, typically for purposes of interrogation. Any Lost and any Shadow lands creature can be targeted with this spell. It can also target other spirit creatures who are tainted. It cannot affect any other creatures. The spell is a ritual, and requires ten minutes to cast (making it quite hazardous when dealing with a rampaging oni), but if additional shugenja join in casting the spell the casting time is reduced by 1 minute per shugenja, to a minimum of 1 minute. If it is cast successfully, the casters make a Contested Roll of their combined Earth Rings against to be Earth of the target. If the casters win, the spell calls forth manacles of pure elemental jade, which imprison the creature and render it helpless with the pain of its searing bonds for the duration of the spell. When the spell expires, however, the manacles instantly crumble into dust, and the creature is liable to seek immediate and bloody vengeance on its captors.</Description>

However, if the target suffers two consecutive failures, he has fallen unconscious and will die within 1 minute unless some form of magical or medical intervention is made.

		<Description>The wind itself will take form to defend you. The ultimate actualization of the Summon spell, this spell summons a massive kami of pure air to serve you. It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with an indistinct outline visible only because of small debris caught up in its body. The kami may move up to 10' x your Air per round, and generates powerful winds in a twenty foot radius around it that hinder movement, preventing anyone from making Simple Move Actions within its area of effect. The manifest kami is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Air Ring, and attacks with a Jujitsu Skill Rank equal to half your Air Ring. Damage from these attacks has a DR equal to your Air Ring (for example, a spirit summoned by a shugenja with Air 6 would inflict 6k6 damage with its attacks). For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal tour Air Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties. It is Invulnerable (see the creature rules in the Book of Void for details of this ability). If it is successfully reduced to zero Wounds, it is dispelled.</Description>

These figures may be as detailed or as vague as you prefer (such as "Crane bushi" versus "heavy infantry of the fourth Daidoji legion"), although you must be familiar with their appearance in order for this spell to take effect (you could not, for example, replicate a family man you have never seen). The figures are fully mobile and will take whatever actions you desire as long as they do not leave the spells area of effect. They can be seen, heard, or even smelled, but as with most illusions, they cannot physically interact with objects or individuals in any way.</Description>

		<Description>The wrath of the air kami, and of the Fortune of the Wind, is truly dreadful to behold. In casting this spell, you unleash the full force of a hurricane upon your enemies. When the spell takes effect, you are standing in the eye of the storm, a zone radiating twenty feet in every direction from you, and in which no ill effects of the spell are suffered. Outside the eye, however, the brutal effects of the storm tear at everything in its path. Objects weighing less than five hundred pounds are lifted by the wind and tossed into the storm. Individuals in this area must hold on to something immobile or be cast into the winds to their certain death. Everyone within the affected region who does not have sturdy shelter suffers 1k1 Wounds per minute from the winds and minor debris. There is a one in ten chance each minute that an exposed individual will instead suffer 5k5 Wounds due to being struck by a wind-borne object. This spell lasts for a maximum of one hour, although it can last far shorter times if you are disrupted while maintaining the spell. This spell may not be cast in a given area more than once per month, as it completely exhausts the favors of the air Kami to perform it.</Description>

The target radiates the sacred green light of jade, and while the spell lasts, he cannot gain the Shadowlands Taint and is completely immune to the effects of all Maho spells. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who possesses at least one full Rank of Taint, for the pure jade spirits will recoil from such a corrupt individual, immediately alerting the caster to this individuals Tainted nature.</Description>

The Earth spirits absorb all damage which the targets suffer while the spell lasts. However, there are limits to even Earth's endurance. Nemuranai can bypass the protection. Further, if the Earth spirits protecting a specific target absorb a total of 100 Wounds of damage, they will be exhausted and the spells effects on that target come to an end.</Description>

		<Description>The most powerful of the binding spells which Earth shugenja use to deal with dangerous creatures, this spell can literally imprison the essence of such a creature for as long as the caster desires. Casting this spell requires that the caster possess a gem or pearl in which to imprison the creature (the GM may, discretionally, allow other rare or precious items to be used, such as a beautifully inlaid puzzle-box or a crystal pendant). The spell can target any creature native the realms of Jigoku, Gaki-Do, or Toshigoku, and any other non-human creature with at least 1 full Rank of Taint. After casting the spell, the caster must make a Contested Willpower roll against the target. If the caster wins, the creature's physical body vanishes and its essence is imprisoned within the item. It will remain there indefinitely unless the item is physically destroyed. If that happens, the released creature immediately resumes its physical form, and will most likely seek vengeance against the caster or his descendants.</Description>

It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with a broad body and thick limbs all formed from earth and stone. This mighty Earth kami may move up to 5x your Earth per round, and its footsteps shake the Earth 1n a twenty foot radius around it, preventing anyone from making Simple Move Actions within its area of effect. This Earth spirit is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Earth Ring, and attacks with a Jujitsu Skill Rank equal that of your Earth Rank. The DR from these attacks is equal to your Earth Ring. The kami can carry up to 1,000 pounds of weight if so commanded, and its blows are strong enough to destroy any wooden structure and to shatter stone walls of one-foot thickness. For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal to your Earth Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties.

Unlike most spells, this is not something that is taught by others, but rather is simply learned through insight by those capable of casting it (and as such it has no scroll associated with it). This spell, more of a meditation ritual, actually allows you to commune with the Void Dragon itself, a feat few mortals have ever managed to perform successfully. During your brief moments of contact with this divine entity, you may ask it questions as you see fit. The Void Dragon knows all that can be known, although it is under no particular compulsion to answer you directly, or even at all. Respect must be maintained at all times, for those who have attempted this feat in the past and failed to pay homage to their patron have ceased to exist altogether.</Description>

		<Description>Everything that exists has a pattern in the Void, a thread woven in the tapestry that is existence. By recalling the memory of that pattern, you can reverse recent effects that have happened to a living creature. When you cast this spell on an individual, you are essentially restoring their existence within the Void in accordance with their previous self. Upon completion of the spell, the person is immediately restored to the state they were in eight hours prior to when the spell was begun. Any injuries suffered during this time, the effects of diseases or poisons, even the acquisition of supernatural conditions such as the Shadowlands Taint or corruption by the Lying Darkness, can be undone in this manner. Upon the completion of this spell, you lose all Void Points, and you may not regain Void Points for a period of three days, after which they will begin to recover at one Void Point per day until you have your maximum normal amount again. This spell cannot be used to restore someone who has died.</Description>

		<Description>The most powerful and terrifying ability of those who command the Void is the ability to destroy the bonds that exist between the five elements. By eradicating the bonds between existing elements, you can effectively cause one object or creature to cease to exist. When you cast this spell on a living creature, you must succeed at a Contested Roll using your Void against the target's Earth. If you are successful, they are instantly killed, and their remains disappear into the Void. Success is automatic against a non-magical object, but attempting to destroy an awakened object, such as a Nemuranai, may have dire ramifications at the GM's discretion. The kami contained within an awakened object frequently respond very poorly to this manner of attack, for instance.</Description>

The kami may move up to 15' x your Water per round, and saturates the ground in a 20' radius around it, ensuring that all terrain in that area is at least Moderate Terrain (unless it was already Difficult). The manifest kami is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Water Ring, and attacks with a jiujutsu Skill Rank equal to half your Water Rank.

So long as the target is within the spell's range, the spell will succeed. Due to the impact of these disturbing and distracting dreams, the victim of this spell becomes vulnerable to future manipulation by the caster.

		<Description>A deceptive spell which allows many maho-tsukai to masquerade as noble priests, healing the injured. This spell convinces the kansen to flow into the target, stimulating his flesh to heal and knit itself closed, and stimulating his body to feats of physical prowess. The target immediately heals 1k1 Wounds, and for the duration of the spell one of his physical Traits (chosen by the caster) is treated as one Rank higher. (This can award a temporary increase in Wounds if it causes the target's Earth Ring to increase, but the Wounds will drop back to normal when the spell expires, and this may result in the death of the target if he has taken sufficient injury.) However, there is a cruel price for this assistance from the kansen: the target of spell immediately gains 1k1 points of Shadowlands Taint.</Description>

It must be cast on a corpse which is within the spells range - it cannot target a living creature. The corpse will be animated by a kansen, rising up and serving the caster as best it can. Mechanically, the animated corpse is considered a zombie (as per the Book of Void, page 331). It obeys any simple commands (such as "kill them" or "wait here") from the maho-tsukai who summoned it. Complex or conditional orders cannot be understood, and the zombie will simply stand and wait until it is given an order simple enough to understand. Once created, it can move freely beyond the spell's initial range. If the zombie is beheaded or destroyed, it will not re-animate unless the spell is cast again. At the end of the spell's duration, the kansen will depart and the undead creature will collapse to the ground, becoming nothing more than a corpse.</Description>

The message is written in blood onto any flat surface, and may be up to ten words long (Raises can be taken ro lengthen the message). When the message is completed, the blood will sink into the surface and disappear, reappearing later when a condition set by the caster is fulfIlled. Conditions for the message's reappearance can be as simple or as complex as the caster might desire, so long as they are conditions the kansen can reasonably perceive (GM's judgment). Until the message reappears, it is physically undetectable, although spells such as Sense or By the Light of the Moon will detect something magically concealed in the surface. If the spell's duration expires without the trigger-event taking place, the hidden blood will reappear without forming the message.</Description>

		<Description>This sinister curse is employed by maho-tsukai both to control their own Taint and to spread the gift of Jigoku to others. The spell targets two people, at least one of which must have the Shadowlands Taint. The spell causes some of this Taint to leave that creature and transfer to the other, the kansen gleefully carrying the gift of Jigoku from one creature to the other. The maximum number of Taint points which can be moved in this manner is equal to The caster's Earth + Insight Rank - however, it can never remove the last point of Taint from the target. (Once the Taint has its grip on someone, it is supremely unwilling to let go.) If the person receiving the Taint is an unwilling target, the caster must succeed in a Contested Willpower roll against the target, or the spell fails.</Description>

		<Description>This spell allows a maho-tsukai to exert his will against any undead creatures in the area, taking control of them and forcing them to obey his will. If the spell targets a mindless uncontrolled creature such as a zombie, the caster takes control of it automatically. If the spell targets a free-willed undead creature such as a pennaggalon, the caster must succeed in a Contested Willpower roll against the creature. Likewise, if the spell targets an undead creature controlled by someone else (another maho-tsukai, oni lord, etc), the caster must succeed in a Contested Willpower roll against the controller. Once controlled, the undead will obey the caster's commands for the duration of the spell, subject to the limits of the creature's intelligence. Zombies will typically only be able to comprehend the most basic of orders ("kill him," etc). At the end of the spell's duration, the undead either revert to the control of their previous master (if they had one) or become free-willed once more.</Description>

		<Description>A more powerful form of the spell Disrupt Limb, this spell inflicts an overwhelming barrage of angry Water kansen on the target. The kansen flow through his body, inflicting headache, weakness. fatigue, and muscle tremors. For the duration of the spell, he is at a +10 TN penalty to all physical and mental activities that require Skill or Trait rolls. (This includes Spell Casting rolls.) He also suffers a -10 penalty to his Armor TN, as the debilitation makes it difficult for him to dodge blows.</Description>

		<Description>The target of this spell is infused with Air kansen which cause him to suffer a sudden, violent, murderous rage against whoever he is looking at or speaking with when the spell takes effect. (Cunning maho-tsukai usually cast this spell from concealment, to avoid the risk that the rage might he directed against them.) For the duration of the spell, the victim will be consumed with murderous, uncontrollable rage, unable to think of anything but killing this person. He will immediately attack the object of his hatred to the very best of his ability. At the start of each Turn, the victim may roll his Honor at TN 30 to control the rage for that Round. The victim will only be able to take Free and Simple Actions during that Round, since so much of his energy is dedicated to conrrolling the anger.</Description>

		<Description>This spell is among the most secret spells employed by the leaders of the Bloodspeaker cult, and is quite rare among maho-tsukai outside of that elite group. It allows the caster to literally cheat death, for himself or another person. The spell must be cast on its target while still alive, and its protective effect normally lasts 24 hours, although skilled spell casters can extend it. If the target dies within the duration of the spell, powerful kansen will cany his soul away, preventing it from passing on to Meido for judgment. Exactly eight hours after death, they will bring hack the soul and re-infuse it into the body, and the target rises from the dead at the Down Wound Rank. Returning from the dead in this way inflicts a full Rank of Taint on the target, due to his soul having been in the care of kansen for eight hours. This blasphemous resurrection will work as long as the target's corpse is still intact - even if limbs have been lost or the head severed, the body will reassemble itself when the kansen return. The only way to prevent the resurrection is to scatter the body parts or burn the corpse to ashes.</Description>

		<Description>A more powerful form of undead summoning, this spell animates a dead corpse into an undead warrior. Unlike the minor, temporary zombies created by "Summon Undead Champion," this spell binds a kansen into a dead body, creating a powerful Tainted revenant which serves the caster to the best of its ability. The resulting creature is described as "Undead Revenant" in the Book of Void, page 330. The revenant will last indefinitely (until destroyed), and the Taint infusing its body prevents it from decaying further. It cannot speak, but can understand and obey any verbal command. It will serve the maho-tsukai who summoned it until it is physically destroyed.</Description>

		</Raises>
		<Description>Among the most hazardous spells in the maho-tsukai's repertoire, this spell summons forth an oni from Jigoku. The oni appears anywhere the caster desires within the range of the spell, and must immediately be given a name - either the caster's own name or the name of another person closely connected to the caster (a close friend, immediate blood relative, or someone who owes the caster their life) - or it will simply depart back to Jigoku. A name, however, anchors the oni into Ningen-do and allows it to remain within the mortal realm. Once the caster has given the oni a name he must engage in a Contested Willpower roll against it. If the caster gave the oni his own name, he gains a +3k2 bonus to this roll. The caster may also Raise when casting Summon Oni to gain additional unkept dice on this roll. The GM should determine the Willpower of the oni - the more powerful the oni, the higher its Willpower. If the caster wins the roll, the oni will obey his commands (at least for now). If the oni wins the roll however, it is free of control and typically runs amok until it is destroyed. Naming an oni is a perilous business, for the oni will try to steal the name away and thereby gain full autonomy and the ability to remain in the mortal realm. Such creatures become Oni Lords, monstrously powerful, able to spawn lesser but still potent copies of themselves. Thus summoned oni will typically not immediately attack the persons who gave them names, seeking instead to leave them alive until they can steal the names completely. Any person who shares their name with an oni will acquire an Oni Mark, a small discoloration on the skin. Every day the bearer of an Oni Mark must make an Earth roll to resist gaining the Shadowlands taint as the connection to the oni corrupts them {see the Taint rules for more details}. Each week they must make another Contested Willpower Roll, similar to the first, against the oni in order to avoid surrendering their name to it. The oni gains +1k1 to this roll for each Rank of Shadowlands Taint the Mark has inflicted on its bearer. If the name-bearer is the same person who summoned the oni, he continues to gain the +3k2 bonus to the roll, plus any bonuses from Raises on the original spell. If the oni ever wins this roll it steals the victim's name and becomes an Oni Lord, freeing itself from any control by its summoner (even if that person is different from the one with the Oni Mark). The now-nameless victim of the Oni Mark becomes a slave of the oni and must obey its commands. If the oni is destroyed or otherwise banished back to Jigoku, it loses its connection to the person with its name and the Oni Mark disappears.</Description>

In fact, he will find himself blurting out any dangerous or damaging secrets he possesses.

		<Description>A dark counterpoint to the binding spells practiced by Earth shugenja, this spell summons the kansen to bind and trap living creatures (it cannot affect the undead). When the spell is cast, manacles of dark, rusty iron burst from the ground and ensnare the target, trapping him and holding him in place. The target is rendered immobile and helpless, unable to take any physical actions other than to try to break free (although he can still speak). The victim can only break free by making a Contested Roll of his Strength against the Earth of the maho-mahotsukai who cast the spell. (The caster may take Raises to gain additional unkept dice on this roll) When the spell expires, the manacles melt away into a disgusting black ooze.</Description>

		<Description>This fearsome spell allows the maho-tsukai to take direct possession of another person, forcing his soul into the victim's body and controlling it like a puppet. The caster must know the name of his chosen victim and must also have either a drop of blood or a piece of hair from the target. Once the spell is cast, the maho-tsukai must make a Contested Willpower Roll against the target. (The caster may take Raises to gain unkept dice on this roll.) If the target wins the roll, the possession fails, and the caster suffers 2k1 Wounds as the angry kansen lash back at the one who summoned them. If the caster wins the roil, he takes complete possession of the victim's body and may use it as he sees fit. He does not, however, gain any of the possessed body's memories, knowledge, or instincts. In mechanical terms, the possessed body has its own physical Traits and Advantages but has the mental Traits,mental/spiritual Advantages, School Techniques, and Skills of the possessing maho-tsuka. The spell's victim experiences what is happening to him in an eerie, dream-like manner. When the spell's duration ends, the caster's soul returns to his own body, and the victim regains control of himself - and must face the consequences of what he did while possessed. While the possession lasts, the caster's body is in a comatose state. He can end the possession early and return to his own body at will. If the possessed body is killed, he will immediately return to his own body. If his own body is killed while he possesses another, he will have no place to return when the spell expires and will thus die the moment the spell's duration ends.</Description>

The recipient of the spell gains + 1 Rank to his Earth Ring and his other three physical Traits for the duration of the spell. (The caster may Raise to increase the Traits, but the Earth Ring cannot be increased further.) He also gains the ability to see through any sort of visual impairment - fog, smoke, or even complete darkness. The physical evidence of this magical enhancement is obvious and grotesque - the target's flesh swells and bulges unnaturally and his eyes turn blood-red. This spell increases the target's Wounds per Rank to match his enhanced Earth Rank. When the spell expires and the Earth Ring drops back to normal, the target's Wounds also return to normal levels. This can result in death if he has suffered serious damage while under the spell's effects.</Description>

    <Description>A ritual spell first used by the notorious Doji Nashiko, this spell is also employed by many other maho-tsukai, and has found its way into the repertoire of several Bloodspeaker Cult cells. The spell is a ritual and requires the caster to dance for at least an hour (rolling Perform: Dance / Awareness at TN 25) while casting – if the dance is interrupted or the Skill roll is unsuccessful, the spell fails. However, if the spell succeeds, the caster may choose either to gain a Physical or Mental Advantage for the duration of the spell, or inflict a Physical or Mental Disadvantage on another person within range for the duration of the spell. (The caster need not be able to see the target so long as he is within range.) The maximum Experience Point value of an Advantage or Disadvantage created by the spell is equal to the caster’s Air + Insight Rank + Taint Rank, if any.

    <Description>This spell is a perverse inversion of the elemental spell Tomb of Jade. Instead of targeting those with the Taint, it targets those who are pure of soul – the spell cannot affect anyone who has at least one full Rank of Taint. The victim of Tomb of Earth is held immobile as he begins turning to stone, beginning with the skin and working its way inward. Each Round (including the Round the spell is cast) on the caster’s Turn, the caster makes an Opposed Roll of his Insight / Earth against the target’s Insight / Air. If the caster wins, the target remains immobilized by the spell (unable to take Actions of any kind) and suffers 2k2 damage. If the target wins, the spell’s effects end. If the target is killed by the spell, he is turned completely to stone, which crumbles to dust within 24 hours.</Description>

    <Description>This horrible spell infuses the target’s bloodstream with angry Fire kansen, causing his blood to superheat and boil through his skin, emerging as a cloud of reddish vapor. The target suffers Wounds with a DR equal to his Fire, and must roll Willpower at TN 20 or fall Prone due to the unbearable pain. Whether or not the target falls prone, he is considered to be Fatigued on his next two Turns, due to the debilitating effect of the boiling blood.</Description>

    <Description>This is an extremely vicious defensive spell which high-ranking Bloodspeaker leaders frequently use to defend themselves. When the spell is cast, the maho-tsukai chooses one living target within range. For the duration of the spell, any time the caster suffers Wounds from any source, he only takes 25% of the damage rolled (rounded down). The target of the spell takes the other 75% (rounded up). Casting this spell does not produce any obvious visual effect, but each time the spell shifts damage to the target, the caster glows with unholy reddish-black energy, while appropriate injuries (burns, cuts, etc) spontaneously appear on the target. This spell works on all Wound damage, even from spells like Jade Strike that normally could not hurt the target.</Description>

    <Description>A hideous and blasphemous spell that many Bloodspeakers use to artificially extend their lifespans. The caster touches one living being, who must be either willing or physically helpless (securely bound, asleep, or unconscious). The caster must make an Opposed Earth Roll against an unwilling victim. If the spell is successful, the maho-tsukai consumes the victim’s life force, killing him instantly. In return, the caster heals all physical injuries, regrows any missing limbs or organs, and extends his life by one year. Although this spell has no obvious or immediate side-effects, using it repeatedly will have a price – the maho-tsukai will acquire a desiccated, almost mummified appearance, making his true nature increasingly difficult to conceal.</Description>

    <Description>This spell is favored by Bloodspeaker cell leaders, who use it to maintain psychological dominance over their followers. The spell’s name is an ironic joke within the cult’s ranks. The spell creates a false aura of calm and well-being that lasts for several hours. This makes it difficult for them to focus their attention or resist appeals from others. Anyone who is within the spell’s area of effect, or who enters it while the spell is in effect, suffers a –1k0 penalty to all Skill and Trait rolls that use Awareness or Willpower. This penalty lasts until the end of the spell’s duration, but does not stack with itself.</Description>

    <Description>This spell is, to the best of anyone’s knowledge, known only to two people – Iuchiban and Yajinden. They have guarded its secrets carefully and so far no other maho-tsukai has ever exhibited its power. The spell allows the caster to literally “leap” his soul into the body of another person within range, instantly and permanently taking their body as his own. The caster must succeed in a Contested Willpower roll against the victim, and if the victim wins, the caster is hurled back into his current body. (The victim will be very much aware that he just fought off some kind of terrible all-consuming power.) The spell does not normally cause the souls to “switch”– the abandoned body simply falls dead. The fate of the original soul is unknown, and some Rokugani believe it may actually be destroyed, a truly horrific and blasphemous act. There are some reports of powerful Lost or maho-tsukai being able to switch into the other body rather than be destroyed, but these tales are not confirmed. The occupied body retains its physical Traits and physical Advantages and Disadvantages, but instantly acquires the mental Traits and Void of the caster, along with all of the caster’s Skills and any Mental or Spiritual Advantages and Disadvantages the caster may have. (Social Advantages or Disadvantages may or may not persist – the GM should adjudicate such situations.) If the maho-tsukai remains within the same body for an extended period of time (six months or more) it will gradually change to physically resemble the caster’s original physical form, changing Rings, Traits, and Advantages as appropriate.</Description>
