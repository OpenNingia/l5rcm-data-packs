        <Description>
The shugenja who serve the Mantis are taught many techniques
that allow them to placate the elements, even under
extreme circumstances. When confronted with dif-
ficult weather conditions, you may negate them by
spending a Void Point as a Simple Action. This af-
fects an area equal to your School Rank x 20 feet
in all directions from you. In a skirmish, this effect
lasts a number of Rounds equal to your School Rank.
Outside of combat, this effect lasts a number of hours
equal to your School Rank. If the weather effect being
negated is the result of a spell, you may only negate
spells with a Mastery Level equal or less than your
School Rank, and then only by spending a number
of spell slots equal to the Mastery Level in addition
to the Void Point.
