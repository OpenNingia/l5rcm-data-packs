The Mountaineer is a rugged warrior whose constant dealings with
the unpredictability of nature makes him ready for
anything that may await him in battle. When you are
surprised during a skirmish due to failing your Investigation
(Notice) / Perception Contested Roll, you may
immediately make a second roll using Athletics / Agility.
If you are successful, you are not surprised. You
may also add half your Athletics Skill Rank (rounded up)
to the total of all your ranged attack rolls.
