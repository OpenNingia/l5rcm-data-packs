				<Description>The Scales of the Carp operate beneath the level where most samurai take notice, and are adept at convincing the authorities – especially those on either side of the Crab-Crane border – to ignore their activities. You gain a +1k0 bonus to all Temptation (Bribery) rolls. If the roll is against a Crab or Crane samurai, the bonus is +1k1 instead, and if the samurai agrees to the bribe you may (with the GM’s permission) spend a Void Point to gain him as an Ally with 1 point of Devotion. He will remain an Ally permanently unless you betray him or otherwise break the alliance.</Description>
