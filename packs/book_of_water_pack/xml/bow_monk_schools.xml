        <Description>The peculiar practices of Heaven’s Mirror monks grant them insights denied to other mortals. You gain a bonus of +1k0 to all Divination Skill rolls. If the roll involves interpretation of an omen, the bonus is +1k1 instead. Once per day, you may spend a Void Point to interpret an omen with absolute accuracy, with no need for a Skill roll to do so. (Of course, the GM still has discretion as to what the correct interpretation of the omen might be.)
    Special: You must be Ascetic and follow the peculiar practices of the Heaven’s Mirror sect, regardless of the social consequences of doing so. Failing to embrace these practices will result in your losing the benefits of your School Technique, and may also result in expulsion from this sect.</Description>
