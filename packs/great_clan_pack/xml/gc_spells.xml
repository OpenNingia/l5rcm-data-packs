The Great Clans, page 283.

As masters of necromancy, the Chuda often find themselves
in need of corpses for their spells and techniques.
This ritual is designed to ensure such corpses are always
available, regardless of circumstances. It normally requires
one hour to complete, although it can be shortened (with
Raises) to a minimum of ten minutes. You may target a
maximum number of corpses equal to your Taint Rank. At
the spell’s conclusion the targeted corpses are prepared for
use. At any later time within the spell’s duration you may
take a Complex Action and expend an Earth spell slot to
instantly summon the prepared corpses to your location.
Chuda Necromancers are particularly fond of using this
spell to summon forth corpses for use with their insidious
Technique.

The kami can be petitioned to coalesce in an area as they do in the coast, creating a thick, obscuring fog. Within the area affected by your spell, the visibility is decreased to a meager five feet. Fabrics and other absorbent materials within the spells area of effect will become damp or even wet if they remain within it long enough. Small sources of open flame such as candles, might be extinguished as well, at the GM's discretion. The moistness of fog is extremely damaging to rice paper.</Description>

This spell infuses the targets (who may include the caster) with firm and unyielding courage, bolstered by the eternal power of the Earth. For the duration of the spell, all the targets gain +5k to resist any kind of Fear effect, whether magical or natural. However, this spell is associated with the memory of the legendary Seven Thunders, and those whose connection the Thunders is tenuous do not receive the same degree of blessing from the Earth kami. Samurai who are not of the original Seven Great Clans receive only + 3k to their rolls to resist Fear. Anyone who has at least a full Rank of Shadowlands Taint cannot benefit from this spell, although this will not actually reveal that they are tainted. This spell may be cast as a combined ritual by two or more shugenja who know the spell, in which case they may add their highest single Earth Rank to their combined total School Ranks to determine how many targets the spell can affect.</Description>

This spell infuses the target with an intense resistance to pain and death, as the Earth kami bolster his will to live to superhuman levels. He is able to shrug off the pain and shock of his wounds, even continuing in the face of lethal injuries for a short time. For the duration of this spell, the target is immune to all Wound Rank penalties and effects - including the effect of being dead if the Out rank is completely filled. When the spell expires, however, the full effects of any Wounds apply immediately - thus, this spell typically affords either a brief chance to be healed before it is too late, or the chance to wage a final battle in the face of certain death.</Description>

This spell infuses the target with the strength of Earth to such a degree that his Rings and Traits become wholly resistant to any effort to change them. Any physical or magical effect which would raise or lower his Traits or Rings is completely ineffective for the duration of those spell, as the Earth kami normally rebuff any such efforts to alter the target's Elemental balance.</Description>

Fire spirits can be driven away by the proper invocation, a very useful ability in Rokugani towns and cities where the construction is all wood and paper. This spell dismisses the active Fire kami in the area.

This spell, one of to the few directly protective prayers involving the Fire kami, asks the kami to protect one person, enveloping the target in a shroud of bright flames. Neither the caster nor anything he carries takes damage from the spell, but anyone who comes into contact with him or strikes him with a melee attack takes 2k2 Wounds. Anyone the target strikes in melee with an unarmed attack or a weapon he carried when the spell was cast also rakes an extra 2k2 Wounds. Anything the target puts down, however, cannot be picked back up without subjecting it to the damage from the spell. Ranged weapons such as arrows bypass this barrier of fire, dealing Wounds as normal.</Description>

Anyone whose elements are out of balance will feel the effects, and this spell creates this condition deliberately by aggravating the Fire present in the target's body. While the spell is in effect, the target cannot be healed by magical means. Magical spells, items, or Techniques that attempt to restore Wounds to the target automatically fail. (Mundane wound treatment with the Medicine skill will still be effective.) The target may realize something is physically wrong with him but cannot find out what is happening without the help of a shugenja - casting Sense (Fire will show the presence of many excited Fire spirits within the target.</Description>

Fire spirits are known for their erratic and temperamental nature, and shugenja can badly disrupt their foes in battle by imbuing them with this aspect of the element. The target of this spell is filled with the unfocused fury of Fire, enraging him and forcing him to lose perspective. The target immediately assumes the Full Attack Stance and cannot switch from that Stance for the duration of the spell. If the spell is cast out of Battle, the target gains the Brash and Contrary Disadvantages for the duration of the spell. This spells effects can be overcome by those of strong will. The target can attempt to resist with an opposed Willpower roll, but you add you’re Fire to the total of your roll. If the spell is cast in battle, this roll occurs during the Reactions Stage of Battle. The roll occurs once every 10 minutes.</Description>

This mighty prayer calls on all the Fire kami in the area to remain quiet and calm, soothing the agitation which often afflicts them. It is often invoked during major festivals, such as the crowning of a new Emperor. For the duration of the spell, all buildings within the area of effect are immune to the effects of magical fire, and all Fire spells cast within that area have the TN of their Spell Casting Rolls increased by 15. Normal fires will still ignite and burn, but they do so sluggishly, and do not spread easily.</Description>

Water washes away all that is impure, refreshing and reinvigorating all it touches. The target of this spell is instantly refreshed as if he had just arisen from a full night's sleep. This does not restore spent Void Points, but can eliminate fatigue and exhaustion. When used on a shugenja, this spell does restore the spell slots associated with the Void Ring (which can be used for any elements), but not the spell slots associated with other Rings. Abilities that characters may use a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by this spell. No Individual can benefit from Rejuvenating Vapors more than once within a 24-hour period.</Description>

As water grows durable and resistant with the coming winter, so too can the water within the human form become sterner and more durable. The target of this spell has all current Wound Penalties negated for the duration of the spell. Any additional penalties incurred take full effect, using the difference between the negated penalty and the new penalty as the effective penalty incurred. Wounds are not healed by this effect, they simply cease to inhibit those suffering from them.</Description>
